# slider
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Slider project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and learnings

The main React functionalities I learned are how to create a horizontal slider display with an auto-slide functionality and conditional rendering. I made my own setup and styling.
